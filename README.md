This project was made as a job interview requirements for Tokopedia.

The working build is at main branch while all the tests are on the experiment+testing branch.

The stacks used in this project are:

1. React using Create React App
2. Apollo + GraphQL
3. Ant Design Mobile + Ant Design
4. React App Rewired because CRA doesn't support AntDesign
5. Emotion
6. Babel
7. Formik
8. Jest (Some configurations were needed because there was a problem with Ant Design, see here: https://ant.design/docs/react/getting-started#Test-with-Jest)
